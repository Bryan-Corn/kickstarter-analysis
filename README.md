# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Bootcamp analysis for kickstarter data
### Analizing kickstarter project data for trends to increase Louise's play's chances for success
---
## Success rates for all kickstarter projects and specifically plays in the US were the focus when comparing goal and pledge amounts as well as month of of launch.
### Launch month success and failure rates were compared, regardless of year, to investigae seasonal effects on kickstarter outcomes.
### Median and mean goal and pledge amounts were compared after identifying outliers in the data. Consideration was also given for the length of time campaigns were active.
### Success rates with respect to goal amounts were not linear or perfectly correlated but a trend was identified.
---
## Results
### Success rates have been much higher for campaigns initiated in Summer months and considerably lower for campaigns started in Fall and Winter months.

### Data points were limited and the number of backers was not factored into this analysis.
### Additional visualizations and investigation with respect for each cmpaign over time would be useful to show how initial success predicts overal success or failure of a campaign. Do successfull kickstarters start off strong, pick up momentum, or remain steady during the time they are active? Backer count comparisons between failed and successful campaigns could also provide some insight for Louise; should she focus on big donors or reach out to a wider group of donors?
